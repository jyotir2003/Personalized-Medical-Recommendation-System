## 💻 Code Highlights

### Disease Prediction Function
```python
def get_predicted_value(patient_symptoms):
    input_vector = np.zeros(len(symptoms_dict))
    valid_symptoms = []
    invalid_symptoms = []
    
    for item in patient_symptoms:
        if item in symptoms_dict:
            input_vector[symptoms_dict[item]] = 1
            valid_symptoms.append(item)
        else:
            invalid_symptoms.append(item)
    
    # Only predict if there are valid symptoms
    if len(valid_symptoms) > 0:
        return diseases_list[svc.predict([input_vector])[0]], invalid_symptoms
    else:
        return None, invalid_symptoms
```

### Recommendation Helper Function
```python
def helper(dis):
    desc = description[description['Disease'] == dis]['Description']
    desc = " ".join([w for w in desc])

    pre = precautions[precautions['Disease'] == dis][['Precaution_1', 'Precaution_2', 'Precaution_3', 'Precaution_4']]
    pre = [col for col in pre.values]

    med = medications[medications['Disease'] == dis]['Medication']
    med = [med for med in med.values]

    die = diets[diets['Disease'] == dis]['Diet']
    die = [die for die in die.values]

    wrkout = workout[workout['disease'] == dis]['workout']

    return desc, pre, med, die, wrkout
```
